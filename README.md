# MongoDB-Atlas-Cloud-Database-using-a-RESTful-API.
This was a coding exam for which I had 24hrs to complete.

The task was to develop:

(a) A	 solution	 database	 which	 appropriately	 models	 the	 data	 required	 for	 the	 coding	 assignment.	 The	 solution	
database	may	be	implemented	using	either	MySQL	or	MongoDB.

(b) A	solution	REST	API	that	provides	CRUD	functionality	for	interacting	with	the	solution	database.	The	API	may	be	
implemented	using	PHP	or	NodeJS/Express.

(c) A	 User	 Interface	 (UI)	 which	 demonstrates	 (i)	 consumption	 of	 the	 REST	 API	 and	 (ii)	 implements	 the	 requested	
functionality	 detailed	 in	 the	 assignment	 brief	 that	 follows.	 You	 may	 implement	 your	 UI	 using	 PHP,	 or	 using	
ExpressJS	in	conjunction	with	a	templating	engine	of	your	choosing.

This assignment was worth 30% of the overall mark for the module CS230.

Unfortunately the full brief has been taken down and I no longer have access to it therefore this is the most information I can give :)
